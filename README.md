# 🎲 Number Guessing Game in Java

A simple console-based number guessing game built in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedback — whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct — and tracks the number of attempts.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess:
   - If the guess is too low → "Too Low! Try again"
   - If the guess is too high → "Too High! Try again"
   - If correct → congratulatory message + number of attempts
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
